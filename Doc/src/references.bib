    abstract = {The efficiency of quantum computing has recently been extended to machine learning, which has made a significant impact on quantum machine learning. The hybrid structure of quantum and classical ones has developed into the most successful application mode currently due to noisy intermediate scale quantum limitations. In this paper, an improved hybrid quantum-classic convolutional neural network (HQC-CNN) with fast training speed, lightweight, and high performance is proposed. Its convolution layer realizes feature mapping through parameterized quantum circuit, while other layers keep classic operation and finally complete the task of four classifications of brain tumors. The experiment in this paper is based on kaggle brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging public dataset. The final experimental results show that HQC-CNN can effectively classify meningioma, glioma, pituitary, and no tumor with a classification accuracy of 97.8\%. When compared to numerous well-known landmark models, HQC-CNN has obvious advantages.},

ABSTRACT = {The classical neural network has provided remarkable results to diagnose neurological disorders against neuroimaging data. However, in terms of efficient and accurate classification, some standpoints need to be improved by utilizing high-speed computing tools. By integrating quantum computing phenomena with deep neural network approaches, this study proposes an AlexNet–quantum transfer learning method to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. The hybrid model is constructed by extracting an informative feature vector from high-dimensional data using a classical pre-trained AlexNet model and further feeding this network to a quantum variational circuit (QVC). Quantum circuit leverages quantum computing phenomena, quantum bits, and different quantum gates such as Hadamard and CNOT gate for transformation. The classical pre-trained model extracts the 4096 features from the MRI dataset by using AlexNet architecture and gives this vector as input to the quantum circuit. QVC generates a 4-dimensional vector and to transform this vector into a 2-dimensional vector, a fully connected layer is connected at the end to perform the binary classification task for a brain disorder. Furthermore, the classical–quantum model employs the quantum depth of six layers on pennyLane quantum simulators, presenting the classification accuracy of 97% for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 96% for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) for 25 epochs. Besides this, pre-trained classical neural models are implemented for the classification of disorder and then, we compare the performance of the classical transfer learning model and hybrid classical–quantum transfer learning model. This comparison shows that the AlexNet–quantum learning model achieves beneficial results for classifying PD and AD. So, this work leverages the high-speed computational power using deep network learning and quantum circuit learning to offer insight into the practical application of quantum computers that speed up the performance of the model on real-world data in the healthcare domain.},
